# foursquare with nodejs and angularjs integration


#Approach
I have chosen to develop this application using Node, Express, Angular and Bootstrap. 
Because this is the first time I developed in node.js and express.js, I used online tutorials on how to create projects with them and also how to create a base website using express scaffolding. I also used jade templating in the views for the first time and I had to do a bit of research on how to integrate it with angular's ng-views. I like to point out that I really liked how easy is to write tidy html/css with Jade.
